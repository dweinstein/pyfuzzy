INSTALLATION
------------

Obviously, in order to use pyfuzzy you must first install it.
This is quite easy:

    python setup.py install

Note that this installs to the "site" library directory of your local
Python installation: /usr/local/lib/python2.x/site-packages by default
on Unix, "C:\Program Files\Python" by default on Windows.  Since
pyfuzzy is "package-ized", the installation process will create a
subdirectory "fuzzy" under the site library directory.

The installation is by default quite verbose.  You can silence it with
the "-q" option:

    python setup.py -q install

but unfortunately the verbosity (of the underlying distutils installer)
is (currently) all or nothing.
